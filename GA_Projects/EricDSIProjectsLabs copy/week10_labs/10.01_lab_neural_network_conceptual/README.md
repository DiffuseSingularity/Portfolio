# Neural Network Conceptual Lab

In this lab, you'll focus on the conceptual aspects of a neural network. By the end, you should be able to answer these questions:
- What does each piece of a perceptron do?
- How does each piece of a perceptron relate to the other pieces?
- How powerful is a two-layer neural network?
- How can we build a two-layer neural network from scratch to approximate a complicated function?
