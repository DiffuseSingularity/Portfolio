Week 4, Lab 2: Classification Model Evaluation

> Predicting Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD)

We can sketch out the data science process as follows:
1. Define the problem.
2. Obtain the data.
3. Explore the data.
4. Model the data.
5. Evaluate the model.
6. Answer the problem.

In this lab, we're going to focus on steps exploring data, building models and evaluating the models we build.

There are three links you may find important:
- [A set of chronic kidney disease (CKD) data and other biological factors](./chronic_kidney_disease_full.csv).
- [The CKD data dictionary](./chronic_kidney_disease_header.txt).
- [An article comparing the use of k-nearest neighbors and support vector machines on predicting CKD](./chronic_kidney_disease.pdf).
> Honestly, this article is probably worth a read. It's a bit shorter than five pages with about a full page of references and a decent number of graphs that take up space. Even though we haven't seen support vector machines (yet!), it's a good read and shockingly quick for an academic journal article.
