# Project 1 README - SAT Growth Research

The purpose of this project is to offer students of the General Assembly Data Science Immersive an opportunity to do some initial exploratory data analysis on a large enough file that would (under different circumstances) follow trends representational of large datasets.  This specific version of the project was completed by Eric Likhtiger of cohort DSI CC7 NYC Gauss.  

There are a few components of this project within this repository:
1)A folder containing the initial code file provided, which holds several sets of instructions for retrieving, cleaning, combining, analyzing, interpreting, and visualizing 4 .csv files full of data which were ultimately combined into 1.  These .csv files were all similarly formatted columns of data relating information regarding the ACT and SAT standardized tests in the USA in the years 2017 and 2018.  This file was ultimately named **SAT_Growth_Research.ipynb**
2) The aforementioned 4 .csv files, which were ultimately combined into one csv file, a Dataframe called dftestscores2017.csv that the project centered around.  
3) A .pdf containing a Google Slides generated slideshow presentation of insights gathered from the data, geared towards explaining to The College Board, the nonprofit organization that operates the SAT and associated exams, how they can continue to reach more students to take the SAT in order for students to improve their chances in college applications, whether they decide to take the alternative ACT or not.  It is 7 slides to be delivered in junction with an oral presentation with a 5-6 minute timeframe. 
4) This READMEProject1.md file and
5) the original README.md file, renamed to originalrm.md, containing detailed instructions for the full scope of this project, with resources and rubric attached.
