# Part 3

## Overview

Progress report due Wednesday, Jan 30, 2019.

The finish line is in sight! You should have your data in hand and some models made. This portion of the Capstone contains two parts to help really hone your model and develop mastery over your final project.

*Goal*: A written progress report on your project and a detailed 1:1 with your instructor.

## Requirements

The actual deliverable for this section is fairly small. You are expected to submit, via [this Google form (Link TBD)](#), a progress report detailing where you are with your Capstone. The format and content is up to you but, at a minimum, we expect the following:

1. Do you have data fully in hand and if not, what blockers are you facing?
2. Have you done a full EDA on all of your data?
3. Have you begun the modeling process? How accurate are your predictions so far?
4. What blockers are you facing, including processing power, data acquisition, modeling difficulties, data cleaning, etc.? How can we help you overcome those challenges?
5. Have you changed topics since your lightning talk? Since you submitted your Problem Statement and EDA? If so, do you have the necessary data in hand (and the requisite EDA completed) to continue moving forward?
6. What is your timeline for the next week and a half? What do you _have_ to get done versus what would you _like_ to get done?
7. What topics do you want to discuss during your 1:1?

We will use your progress report as a leaping off point for a deep 1:1 with a member of the instructional staff. The best use of your time is to really flesh out this document so that your remaining time here can be most productive.

After you submit this document no later than *end of day, Jan 30, 2019*.
